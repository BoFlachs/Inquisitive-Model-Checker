\section{Inquisitive Semantics}\label{sec: InqB}
% Language
Any standard first-order language $\mathcal{L}$, containing a set of function symbols $\mathcal{F}_\mathcal{L}$ and a set of relation symbols $\mathcal{R}_\mathcal{L}$, is also a language of \textsf{InqB}. In our model checker we do not concern ourselves with function symbols, therefore we will not mention them in the remainder of this report. As for the constants in a language, we will assume that for each individual in the domain of a model we will have a constant in our language. We define models of \textsf{InqB} below.

% Model
\begin{defi}\label{def: InqBModel}
An \textsf{InqB} model for a first-order language $\mathcal{L}$ is a triple $M=\langle W,D,I\rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
    \item $W$ is a non-empty set of possible worlds;
    \item $D$ is a non-empty set of individuals;
    \item $I$ is a map that associates every $w\in W$ with a first order structure $I_w$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
        \item for every $w\in W$, the domain of $I_w$ is $D$;
        \item for every $n$-ary relation symbol $R\in \mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{L}}$, $I_w(R)\subseteq D^n$;
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

% info states
% propositions
Before giving the semantics of \textsf{InqB}, we introduce some terminology. Instead of worlds, inquisitive semantics takes sets of worlds as primitive. A set of worlds is called an information state. A proposition, then, consists of a set of sets of worlds instead of a set of worlds as in classical logic.

\begin{defi}\label{defprop}
 Let $M=\langle W,D,I\rangle$ be a model. An information state $s$ is a set of possible worlds $s\subseteq W$. A proposition $P$ is a non-empty, downwards closed set of information states. The proposition $P$ corresponding to a formula $\varphi$ (in a certain model) is denoted by $[\varphi]$.
\end{defi}

The information states in a proposition correspond to the states in which the issue raised by a proposition is resolved. As smaller information states provide \emph{more} information, the requirement that propositions are downwards closed make sense.

Given Definition \ref{defprop}, we can characterize a proposition in terms of its maximal elements. We call these maximal elements the alternatives of a proposition. If a proposition has more than one alternative, we say that this proposition is inquisitive. Moreover, the union of the sets in a proposition can be viewed as the informative content of a proposition. We formally define these two notions, they will play a role in later sections.

\begin{defi}
 The alternatives of a proposition $P$, denoted by $\alt(P)$, are its maximal elements. The informative content of a proposition $P$, denoted by $\info(P)$, is defined as $\info(P):=\cup P$.
\end{defi}

% Algebraic foundations
In classical logic, logical operations correspond to certain algebraic operations. This is also the case in inquisitive semantics. We will use the algebraic characterization of \textsf{InqB}'s semantics in the implementation of our model checker, hence we also present the semantics in this way here.\footnote{For the semantics of \textsf{InqB} in terms of support conditions, see \cite[p.\ 62-63]{inquisitive19}.} In addition to union and intersection, two more algebraic operations are used: relative and absolute pseudo-complement.

\begin{defi}
 For propositions $P$ and $Q$, the pseudo-complement of $P$ relative to $Q$, denoted by $P\Rightarrow Q$, is defined as $P\Rightarrow Q:= \{s \mid \text{for every } r\subseteq s\text{, if } t\in P\text{, then } t\in Q\}$. For any proposition $P$, the absolute pseudo-complement $P^*$ of $P$ is defined as $P^*:=\{s\mid s\cap t=\emptyset \text{ for all } t\in P\}$.
\end{defi}
% Semantics
Using these algebraic operations, we can now give the semantics of \textsf{InqB}.

\begin{defi}\label{defsemantics}
 The semantics of \textsf{InqB} are given by:
 \begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
     \item $[R(t_1,\dots,t_n)] := \mathcal{P}(|R(t_1,\dots,t_n)|)$;
     \item $[\neg \varphi]:=[\varphi]^*$;
     \item $[\varphi\land\psi]:=[\varphi]\cap [\psi]$;
     \item $[\varphi\lor\psi]:=[\varphi]\cup [\psi]$;
     \item $[\varphi\rightarrow\psi]:=[\varphi]\Rightarrow [\psi]$;
     \item $[\forall x . \varphi(x)]:= \cap_{d\in D} [\varphi(d)]$;
     \item $[\exists x . \varphi(x)]:= \cup_{d\in D} [\varphi(d)]$,
 \end{enumerate}
 where $|R(t_1,\dots,t_n)|$ denotes the set of worlds where $R(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is classically true.
\end{defi}
% projection operators
Lastly, we introduce two new projection operators: `$!$' and `$?$'. We call these projection operators because they project a proposition on the set of purely informative propositions and the set of purely inquisitive propositions, respectively.

\begin{defi}\label{defproject}
 For any proposition $P$, we have:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item $!P:= \mathcal{P}(\info(P))$;
     \item $?P:= P\cup P^*$.
 \end{itemize}
\end{defi}

We can express $!P$ in terms of our algebraic operators as $!P=P^{**}$. It then follows from Definition \ref{defsemantics} and Definition \ref{defproject} that we can express the projection operators in terms of negation and disjunction: $!\varphi \equiv \neg\neg\varphi$ and $?\varphi\equiv \varphi \lor \neg \varphi$. So we do not have to add these operators to our language in order to make our language more expressive.

This concludes our introduction to \textsf{InqB}. In the next section we will discuss how we implemented \textsf{InqB} in Haskell.
